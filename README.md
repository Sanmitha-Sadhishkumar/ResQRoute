# ResQRoute
This project creates an intelligent fire evacuation system using 3D models and real-time fire simulations. Deep learning dynamically adapts routes based on fire spread, obstacles, and crowd movement. By learning from past incidents, it improves safety, optimizes paths, and enhances emergency response.
