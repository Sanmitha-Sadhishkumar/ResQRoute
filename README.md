# ResQRoute
Fire safety in human settlements is a complex challenge due to difficulties in
evacuation and the unpredictable behavior of occupants during emergencies. Existing
systems often rely on static models and predefined evacuation routes, which do not
account for dynamic factors such as fire spread, crowd movement, and obstacles like
blocked exits. Additionally, they often overlook emotional responses, fire dynamics,
and the effects of smoke, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

This project aims to address these limitations by developing an intelligent
fire evacuation system that integrates 3D building models with real-time fire and smoke
simulations. The system uses deep learning to dynamically generate adaptive evacuation
routes based on evolving fire conditions, crowd movement, and obstacles. By learning
from past incidents, it improves evacuation planning and response accuracy, ensuring
safer and more efficient evacuations.

The outcome of the project includes the successful transition from 2D
blueprints to realistic 3D models for simulating evacuation scenarios. The system
dynamically generates optimal evacuation routes, considers hazardous materials, and
helps responders navigate more effectively. By combining crowd behavior analysis,
fire detection, and firefighter path optimization, the system enhances both evacuation
safety and emergency response times, providing a proactive, data-driven solution for
fire safety.
